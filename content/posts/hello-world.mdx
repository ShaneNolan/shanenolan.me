title: Clean Code - Enums

Enums are a powerful data type that allow for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. They help improve 
`code readability`, `enforce correct values` and also help adhere to the `DRY` software development principle.

Let me show you what I mean with code examples 🤓!

## Code without using a Enum
The below code shows a simple `Game` class, that has a difficulty as an attribute, coded in Python 3.7 utilising the 
[dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) feature.

The code simply outputs the difficulty of the current game. A difficulty can either be ``Easy``, ``Medium`` or ``Hard``. 
If an invalid difficulty is passed a ``ValueError`` raised.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Game:
    """
    Three difficulties: 
      "Easy",
      "Medium",
      "Hard"
    """
    __difficulty: str

    @property
    def difficulty(self) -> str:
        return "The difficulty current is: {}".format(self.__difficulty)
    
    @difficulty.setter
    def difficulty(self, difficulty: str):
        if difficulty != "Easy" or difficulty != "Medium" or difficulty != "Hard":
            raise ValueError("Invalid difficulty supplied: {}".format(difficulty))
        self.__difficulty = difficulty


if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game("Easy")
    print(game.difficulty)
```
```
The difficulty current is: Easy
```

## Code using a Enum
Lets refactor the above code utilising enumartion to make it more ``readable`` and ``maintainable`` ✨.

Maintainability is increased because we will only need to update a difficulty value in one place. 
Additionally we can `easily add another difficulty` without the need for another if statements, due to ``enforced values``.

If we create a Enum called Difficulties with three attributes; ``EASY``, ``MEDIUM`` and ``HARD`` 
we can pass one of those Enum values into a Game object. 

So lets code a Enum 🤓.

```python
from enum import Enum

class Difficulties(Enum):
    EASY = "Easy"
    MEDIUM = "Medium"
    HARD = "Hard"
```

We can call that enum and access any of its attributes, like this:
```python
print(Difficulties.HARD.name)
HARD

print(Difficulties.HARD.value)
Hard
```

We can remove the three if statements after we recode the difficulty setter function parameter to accept ``Difficulties``.

```python
@difficulty.setter
def difficulty(self, difficulty: Difficulties):
    self.__difficulty = difficulty
```

Way cleaner right? 😎

## Enum Automation
Personally, I found it annoying assigning each enum attribute a value.
Therefore, I created a class overriding the ``_generate_next_value_()`` function used by the 
[auto()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#using-automatic-values) enum function, 
to automatically generate values.

It simply returns the enum ``.name`` value
[titled](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title) 😮.

```python
from enum import Enum, auto

class AutoTitleName(Enum):
  def _generate_next_value_(name, start, count, last_values):
    return name.title()

class Difficulties(AutoTitleName):
    EASY = auto()
    MEDIUM = auto()
    HARD = auto()
```

```python
print(Difficulties.MEDIUM)
Medium
```

Looks pretty neat to me. Now lets put it all together 👍:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum, auto

class AutoTitleName(Enum):
  def _generate_next_value_(name, start, count, last_values):
    return name.title()

class Difficulties(AutoTitleName):
    EASY = auto()
    MEDIUM = auto()
    HARD = auto()

@dataclass
class Game:
    __difficulty: Difficulties

    @property
    def difficulty(self) -> str:
        return "The difficulty current is: {}".format(self.__difficulty.value)
    
    @difficulty.setter
    def difficulty(self, difficulty: Difficulties):
        self.__difficulty = difficulty


if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game(Difficulties.EASY)
    print(game.difficulty)
```
```
The difficulty current is: Easy
```

Ta-da, look how much easier it is to read and maintain the code 🤩. 

## Enum Hack
Personally, I find the ``.name`` and ``.value`` enum properties ugly and prefer to access the .value directly, like this:

```python
print(Difficulties.EASY)
Easy
```

To do this *"hack"* you subclass the ``EnumMeta`` class and override the 
[\_getattribute\_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattribute__) function 🤯. 

**Note:** ``__getattribute__`` is used for all attribute access, so you have to ensure the retrieved value is an instance of the current class.

Makes sense? Perfect, here is the code:

```python
from enum import Enum, auto, EnumMeta 

class EnumMetaDirectValue(EnumMeta):
    """
    Metaclass to access a enum .value directly.
    """

    def __getattribute__(cls, name):
        value = super().__getattribute__(name)
        if isinstance(value, cls):
            value = value.value
        return value

class Difficulties(AutoTitleName, metaclass=EnumDirectValueMeta):
    EASY = auto()
    MEDIUM = auto()
    HARD = auto()
```

```python
print(Difficulties.EASY)
Easy
```

Now you might argue why not just override the ``__str__`` function? Well for this example it would work but, 
other projects might store objects in their Enums such as a ``Pathlib`` object and returning the actual object 
and not a type ``__str__`` would reduce overhead and complexity.

## Conclusion
Hopefully this first blog post showed you how utilising enums can produce beautiful clean code 😃.
